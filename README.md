ITI WEB API PROJECT
Description
This project was created as part of an ITI database training, focusing on managing a complete academic system that includes students, instructors, departments, and courses.
It handles complex relationships between these entities and provides a structured API to access and manipulate the data effectively.
The main goal of the project is to demonstrate real-world database operations, applying best practices in API development, clean architecture, and design patterns.
Technologies and methodologies used include:
â€¢	Entity Framework Core for database interactions
â€¢	Swagger for API documentation and testing
â€¢	Design Patterns like Unit of Work and Repositories for clean code organization
â€¢	SOLID Principles for maintainable and scalable code
â€¢	Pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
This project is a strong foundation that I plan to expand and improve over time, adding more advanced features and optimizations.
