# Web API project

## ðŸ“‹ Description
This project was created as part of an ITI database training, focusing on managing a complete academic system that includes students, instructors, departments, and courses. It handles complex relationships between these entities and provides a structured API to access and manipulate the data effectively.

The main goal of the project is to demonstrate real-world database operations, applying best practices in API development, clean architecture, and design patterns.

## Key Technologies and Methodologies Used:
Entity Framework Core for database interactions

Swagger for API documentation and testing

Design Patterns like Unit of Work and Repositories for clean code organization

SOLID Principles for maintainable and scalable code

Pagination to handle large datasets efficiently

This project serves as a strong foundation that I plan to expand and improve over time, adding more advanced features and optimizations.

##âœ¨ Features
Full Academic Management System
Manage students, instructors, departments, and courses with full CRUD operations.

Complex Relationships Handling
Efficiently models and manages many-to-many and one-to-many relationships between entities.

RESTful API Endpoints
Provides well-structured and standardized APIs for seamless integration with front-end applications or third-party services.
